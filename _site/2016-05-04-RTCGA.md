# R Toolkit for Biostatistics
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RTCGA/RTCGA/master/RTCGA_workflow_ver3.png'> 

> The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of genome analysis technologies, including large-scale genome sequencing. 

We converted selected datasets from this study into few separate packages that are hosted on Bioconductor. These R packages make selected datasets easier to access and manage. Data sets in RTCGA.data packages are large and cover complex relations between clinical outcomes and genetic background.
