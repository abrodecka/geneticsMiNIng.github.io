# R Toolkit for Biostatistics
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RTCGA/RTCGA/master/RTCGA_workflow_ver3.png'> 

> The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of genome analysis technologies, including large-scale genome sequencing. 


We converted selected datasets from this study into few separate packages that are hosted on Bioconductor. These R packages make selected datasets easier to access and manage. Data sets in RTCGA.data packages are large and cover complex relations between clinical outcomes and genetic background.

Packages from the RTCGA factory  will be useful for at least three audiences: biostatisticians that work with cancer data; researchers that are working on large scale algorithms, for them RTGCA data will be a perfect blasting site; teachers that are presenting data analysis method on real data problems.
